          <h1 class="slide__title">Anthropic's Super Bowl Anti-Ad Play</h1>
          <p class="slide__body">Anthropic spent millions on <strong>Super Bowl ads</strong> with the tagline "Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude," mocking product placements just as OpenAI began rolling ads into the ChatGPT free tier. The campaign drove a <strong>32% download spike</strong> and pushed Claude's app into the top 10, with 148,000 installs in two days. The gambit showed how <strong>differentiation on values</strong> can win mindshare even in a crowded model race.</p>

          <h1 class="slide__title">Goldman Sachs Bets Big on Claude</h1>
          <p class="slide__body">Goldman Sachs deployed Anthropic's Claude across <strong>12,000 developers and thousands of back-office staff</strong>, automating accounting and compliance tasks over a portfolio of $2.5 trillion in assets under supervision. The rollout cut client onboarding times by 30% and boosted developer productivity by more than 20%. The move signals that <strong>regulated financial institutions</strong> now trust AI with mission-critical, error-sensitive judgments at scale.</p>

          <p class="slide__body">Anthropic closed a <strong>$30 billion Series G</strong> led by GIC and Coatue, valuing the company at $380 billion — one of the largest private tech fundraises in history. Enterprise adoption is accelerating sharply: 1 in 5 businesses on Ramp now pay for Anthropic, up from 1 in 25 the previous year. Notably, about <strong>79% of OpenAI users also pay for Anthropic</strong>, suggesting the market is expanding rather than splitting.</p>

          <p class="slide__body">ByteDance unveiled <strong>Seedance 2.0</strong>, an AI video model that processes text, images, audio, and video simultaneously and is aimed at professional film, e-commerce, and advertising. The launch positions China as a contender in <strong>generative video</strong>, the next frontier beyond text AI. It signals that Chinese labs are no longer simply catching up to Western models — they are <strong>leapfrogging entire categories</strong>.</p>

          <h1 class="slide__title">AI Agents Enter the "Centaur Phase"</h1>
          <p class="slide__body">A seismic shift is sweeping Silicon Valley: <strong>autonomous AI agents</strong> can now compress weeks of software engineering work into minutes, creating a sharp divide between AI-enabled teams and traditional ones. Engineers at Anthropic and OpenAI report that nearly <strong>100% of their code is AI-generated</strong>. One developer using Claude Code can now accomplish what a full team once needed a month to deliver, at a fraction of the cost.</p>

          <h1 class="slide__title">Claude Sonnet 4.6 Tops Business Benchmarks</h1>
          <p class="slide__body">Anthropic launched <strong>Claude Sonnet 4.6</strong>, which outperforms both OpenAI's GPT-5.2 and Google's Gemini 3 Pro on agentic financial analysis and office tasks — and even matches or beats Anthropic's own premium Opus model in certain coding benchmarks. Free users get limited access that resets every five hours, while <strong>Claude Pro subscribers</strong> get higher limits for $20 per month. Early-access developers preferred it over all previous Claude versions.</p>

          <p class="slide__body">Google released <strong>Gemini 3.1 Pro</strong>, scoring 77.1% on the ARC-AGI-2 reasoning test — more than double its predecessor's 31.1% — and outperforming Claude Opus 4.6 and GPT-5.2 on most benchmarks. The model targets <strong>science, research, and engineering workflows</strong> rather than broad feature expansion. It is now available through the Gemini app, NotebookLM, and developer APIs, marking Google's latest push to <strong>reclaim the AI model leadership position</strong>.</p>

          <h1 class="slide__title">Anthropic Accuses Chinese Labs of Data Theft</h1>
          <p class="slide__body">Anthropic accused <strong>DeepSeek, Moonshot, and MiniMax</strong> of creating over 24,000 fraudulent accounts to generate more than 16 million exchanges with Claude, using "distillation" to copy its agentic reasoning and coding capabilities into their own models. Anthropic warns that models built through this illicit process lack the <strong>safety guardrails</strong> against bioweapons development and cyber attacks. The case intensified calls for <strong>AI chip export controls</strong> to China.</p>

          <p class="slide__body">Anthropic rolled out major upgrades to <strong>Claude Cowork</strong>, adding pre-built integrations with Google Workspace, DocuSign, and WordPress, plus the ability to pass context across Microsoft Excel and PowerPoint in multi-step automated workflows. The platform positions Claude as a <strong>comprehensive business automation layer</strong> competing head-on with specialized productivity software. Investors sold enterprise SaaS stocks in reaction, fearing AI will displace traditional business applications.</p>

          <p class="slide__body">OpenAI closed a <strong>$110 billion funding round</strong> — one of the largest private raises in history — as ChatGPT reached 900 million weekly active users. Meanwhile, the Pentagon moved to designate Anthropic a <strong>supply-chain risk</strong> after Anthropic refused to lift Claude's military-use restrictions; Claude's App Store ranking surged to #1 as rival AI workers published open letters backing Anthropic's stance. The twin stories captured February's central tension: <strong>immense capital flooding in</strong> while AI safety debates grow louder.</p>
