# Web Presentation Skill

Rules:

- HTML: semantic elements only; headings strictly ordered; labels descriptive; no inline handlers/styles.
- CSS: styles.css only; variables for tokens; no unused selectors; no deprecated/prefixed features.
- JS: addEventListener only; no inline handlers; batch DOM writes; handle missing nodes.
- A11y: prefer native controls; keep keyboard navigation intact.
- Slides: 10 per deck; 1 headline + 2-3 sentences; 1 image + visible credit (original URL + author/host).
- Slides: no eyebrow labels; include a link back to index.html in deck header.
- Slides: source links open in a new tab with rel="noopener".
- Layout: two-column on desktop, stacked on mobile.
